# Flask-Webapp
This project is a training exercise for designing a microservices-based web application using Python, Flask, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other tools. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and learn how to build and deploy a scalable and fault-tolerant system. The application consists of several services, including authentication, catalog, orders, and payments, that communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. Each service is designed as a Docker container and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. Prometheus is used for monitoring the health and performance of the system. This project is an excellent opportunity to learn and apply best practices for designing and deploying modern web applications.
